Install HAProxy
Installation is relatively easy. The below yum command will install the necessary packages along with HAProxy.

yum install haproxy
The end of the output will look like this.

Running transaction
  Installing : haproxy-1.5.18-9.el7.x86_64                    1/1
  Verifying  : haproxy-1.5.18-9.el7.x86_64                    1/1

Installed:
  haproxy.x86_64 0:1.5.18-9.el7
Next, we have to verify that HAProxy starts every time we reboot our server. We can accomplish that with the chkconfig command below.

chkconfig haproxy on
The command’s output will let you know that a symbolic link (symlink) was created for the HAProxy service. A symlink is a feature that helps link to a specific file or folder on your server.

Note: Forwarding request to 'systemctl enable haproxy.service'.
Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/haproxy.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/haproxy.service.
Now we will make sure we are allowing the HAProxy service to run through our firewall. The first command will enable the http server in the firewall.

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http
The next one will permanently open port 8181 in the firewall.

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8181/tcp
And the last one will reload the firewall.

firewall-cmd --reload
All of them will have the same output, as shown below.

success
Starting the Service
Let’s start the service and make sure it’s running. Input the following command to your terminal.

systemctl start haproxy && systemctl status haproxy
The output will look like the one below confirms the service is up and running.
